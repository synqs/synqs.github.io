We are advertising two PhD positions in Physics at the intersection of quantum computing, many-body physics, and neuromorphic computing. The positions involve both theory and experiment and are funded by the Baden-Württemberg Foundation.

### Project description:

Superconducting qubits are one of the prime quantum computing architectures, which will enable large scale quantum simulations and computations in the near future. We work towards developing powerful tools for benchmarking and readout of such devices in a collaborative effort between the experimental groups of A. Ustinov at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and M. Gärttner at Heidelberg University. One PhD student will work experimentally on hardware development, improving the readout capabilities of small-scale superconducting qubit arrays. Another student will develop the necessary theoretical tools for applying machine learning inspired quantum state tomography methods to the produced data and work towards using neuromorphic hardware, available in Heidelberg, to boost the performance of these readout methods and to integrate neuromorphic computing units directly with quantum devices. Successful candidates are expected to have an excellent Masters degree in Physics and ideally are already experienced in quantum many-body physics, experimental low-temperature physics and/or quantum computing.

### How to apply:

Please send your application as a single pdf file to [Alexey Ustinov](mailto:alexey.ustinov@kit.edu) for the experimental position and to [Martin Gärttner](mailto:martin.gaerttner@kip.uni-heidelberg.de) for the theory and neuromorphic hardware positions. The application should in include a letter of motivation (max. 1 page), CV, relevant academic certificates, and the names of two references. Applications will be considered until the positions are filled.
