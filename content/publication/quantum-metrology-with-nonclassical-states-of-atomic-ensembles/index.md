abstract: Quantum technologies exploit entanglement to revolutionize computing,
  measurements, and communications. This has stimulated the research in
  different areas of physics to engineer and manipulate fragile many-particle
  entangled states. Progress has been particularly rapid for atoms. Thanks to
  the large and tunable nonlinearities and the well-developed techniques for
  trapping, controlling, and counting, many groundbreaking experiments have
  demonstrated the generation of entangled states of trapped ions, cold, and
  ultracold gases of neutral atoms. Moreover, atoms can strongly couple to
  external forces and fields, which makes them ideal for ultraprecise sensing
  and time keeping. All these factors call for generating nonclassical atomic
  states designed for phase estimation in atomic clocks and atom
  interferometers, exploiting many-body entanglement to increase the sensitivity
  of precision measurements. The goal of this article is to review and
  illustrate the theory and the experiments with atomic ensembles that have
  demonstrated many-particle entanglement and quantum-enhanced metrology.
