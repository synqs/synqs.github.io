abstract: We present an improved scheme for absorption imaging of alkali atoms at
  moderate magnetic fields, where the excited state is well in the Paschen-Back regime
  but the ground state hyperfine manifold is not. It utilizes four atomic levels to
  obtain an approximately closed optical cycle. With the resulting absorption of the
  corresponding two laser frequencies we extract the atomic column density of a $^{39}$K
  Bose-Einstein condensate. The scheme can be readily applied to all other alkali-like
  species.
