abstract: Antihydrogen atoms with K or sub-K temperature are a powerful tool to precisely
  probe the validity of fundamental physics laws and the design of highly sensitive
  experiments needs antihydrogen with controllable and well defined conditions. We
  present here experimental results on the production of antihydrogen in a pulsed
  mode in which the time when 90% of the atoms are produced is known with an uncertainty
  of $∼$250 ns. The pulsed source is generated by the charge-exchange reaction between
  Rydberg positronium atoms—produced via the injection of a pulsed positron beam into
  a nanochanneled Si target, and excited by laser pulses—and antiprotons, trapped,
  cooled and manipulated in electromagnetic traps. The pulsed production enables the
  control of the antihydrogen temperature, the tunability of the Rydberg states, their
  de-excitation by pulsed lasers and the manipulation through electric field gradients.
  The production of pulsed antihydrogen is a major landmark in the AE $$barg$$ ḡ IS
  experiment to perform direct measurements of the validity of the Weak Equivalence
  Principle for antimatter.
