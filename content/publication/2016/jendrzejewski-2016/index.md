abstract: We propose a new method for creating far-field optical barrier potentials
  for ultracold atoms with widths that are narrower than the diffraction limit and
  can approach tens of nanometers. The reduced widths stem from the nonlinear atomic
  response to control fields that create spatially varying dark resonances. The subwavelenth
  barrier is the result of the geometric scalar potential experienced by an atom prepared
  in such a spatially varying dark state. The performance of this technique, as well
  as its applications to the study of many-body physics and to the implementation
  of quantum information protocols with ultracold atoms, are discussed, with a focus
  on the implementation of tunnel junctions.
