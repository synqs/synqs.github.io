abstract: Polar molecules in an optical lattice provide a versatile platform to study
  quantum many-body dynamics. Here we use such a system to prepare a density distribution
  where lattice sites are either empty or occupied by a doublon composed of an interacting
  Bose-Fermi pair. By letting this out-of-equilibrium system evolve from a well-defined,
  but disordered, initial condition, we observe clear effects on pairing that arise
  from inter-species interactions, a higher partial-wave Feshbach resonance and excited
  Bloch-band population. These observations facilitate a detailed understanding of
  molecule formation in the lattice. Moreover, the interplay of tunnelling and interaction
  of fermions and bosons provides a controllable platform to study Bose-Fermi Hubbard
  dynamics. Additionally, we can probe the distribution of the atomic gases in the
  lattice by measuring the inelastic loss of doublons. These techniques realize tools
  that are generically applicable to studying the complex dynamics of atomic mixtures
  in optical lattices.
