abstract: In contrast to classical empty space, the quantum vacuum fundamentally alters
  the properties of embedded particles. This paradigm shift allows one to explain
  the discovery of the celebrated Lamb shift in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom.
  Here, we engineer a synthetic vacuum, building on the unique properties of ultracold
  atomic gas mixtures, offering the ability to switch between empty space and quantum
  vacuum. Using high-precision spectroscopy, we observe the phononic Lamb shift, an
  intriguing many-body effect originally conjectured in the context of solid-state
  physics.We find good agreement with theoretical predictions based on the Fr√∂hlich
  model. Our observations establish this experimental platform as a new tool for precision
  benchmarking of open theoretical challenges, especially in the regime of strong
  coupling between the particles and the quantum vacuum.
