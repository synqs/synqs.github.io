abstract: The fundamental dynamics of ultracold atomtronic devices are reflected in
  their phonon modes of excitation. We probe such a spectrum by applying a harmonically
  driven potential barrier to a $^23$Na Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring-shaped
  trap. This perturbation excites phonon wavepackets. When excited resonantly, these
  wavepackets display a regular periodic structure. The resonant frequencies depend
  upon the particular configuration of the barrier, but are commensurate with the
  orbital frequency of a Bogoliubov sound wave traveling around the ring. Energy transfer
  to the condensate over many cycles of the periodic wavepacket motion causes enhanced
  atom loss from the trap at resonant frequencies. Solutions of the time-dependent
  Gross-Pitaevskii equation exhibit quantitative agreement with the experimental data.
  We also observe the generation of supersonic shock waves under conditions of strong
  excitation, and collisions of two shock wavepackets.
