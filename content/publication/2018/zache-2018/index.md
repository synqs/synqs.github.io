abstract: Quantum simulators have the exciting prospect of giving access to real-time
  dynamics of lattice gauge theories, in particular in regimes that are difficult
  to compute on classical computers. Future progress towards scalable quantum simulation
  of lattice gauge theories, however, hinges crucially on the efficient use of experimental
  resources. As we argue in this work, due to the fundamental non-uniqueness of discretizing
  the relativistic Dirac Hamiltonian, the lattice representation of gauge theories
  allows for an optimization that up to now has been left unexplored. We exemplify
  our discussion with lattice quantum electrodynamics in two-dimensional space-time,
  where we show that the formulation through Wilson fermions provides several advantages
  over the previously considered staggered fermions. Notably, it enables a strongly
  simplified optical lattice setup and it reduces the number of degrees of freedom
  required to simulate dynamical gauge fields. Exploiting the optimal representation,
  we propose an experiment based on a mixture of ultracold atoms trapped in a tilted
  optical lattice. Using numerical benchmark simulations, we demonstrate that a state-of-the-art
  quantum simulator may access the Schwinger mechanism and map out its non-perturbative
  onset.
