abstract: We introduce a bang-bang shortcut to adiabaticity for the Dicke model, which
  we implement via a two-dimensional array of trapped ions in a Penning trap with
  a spin-dependent force detuned close to the center-of-mass drumhead mode. Our focus
  is on employing this shortcut to create highly entangled states that can be used
  in high-precision metrology. We highlight that the performance of the bang-bang
  approach is comparable to standard preparation methods, but can be applied over
  a much shorter time frame. We compare these theoretical ideas with experimental
  data which serve as a first step towards realizing this theoretical procedure for
  generating multi-partite entanglement.
