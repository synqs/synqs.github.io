abstract: Understanding the behaviour of isolated quantum systems far from
  equilibrium and their equilibration is one of the most pressing problems in
  quantum many-body physics1,2. There is strong theoretical evidence that
  sufficiently far from equilibrium a wide variety of systems—including the
  early Universe after inflation3–6, quark–gluon matter generated in heavy-ion
  collisions7–9, and cold quantum gases4,10–14—exhibit universal scaling in time
  and space during their evolution, independent of their initial state or
  microscale properties. However, direct experimental evidence is lacking. Here
  we demonstrate universal scaling in the time-evolving momentum distribution of
  an isolated, far-from-equilibrium, one- dimensional Bose gas, which emerges
  from a three-dimensional ultracold Bose gas by means of a strong cooling
  quench. Within the scaling regime, the time evolution of the system at low
  momenta is described by a time-independent, universal function and a single
  scaling exponent. The non-equilibrium scaling describes the transport of an
  emergent conserved quantity towards low momenta, which eventually leads to the
  build-up of a quasi-condensate. Our results establish universal scaling
  dynamics in an isolated quantum many-body system, which is a crucial step
  towards characterizing time evolution far from equilibrium in terms of
  universality classes. Universality would open the possibility of using, for
  example, cold- atom set-ups at the lowest energies to simulate important
  aspects of the dynamics of currently inaccessible systems at the highest
  energies, such as those encountered in the inflationary early Universe.
