abstract: 'We have experimentally measured transport of superfluid, bosonic atoms
  in a mesoscopic system: a small channel connecting two large reservoirs. Starting
  far from equilibrium (superfluid in a single reservoir), we observe first resistive
  flow transitioning at a critical current into superflow, characterized by long-lived
  oscillations. We reproduce this full evolution with a simple electronic circuit
  model. We find that the resistance is consistent with phase slips and the associated
  creation of vortices, as proposed in [R. P. Feynman, in $backslash$it Prog. Low
  Temp. Phys., edited by C. J. Gorter (North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam,
  1955), Chap. 2]. We also show that the oscillations are consistent with LC oscillations
  as estimated by the kinetic inductance and effective capacitance in our system.
  Our system allows only a few single-particle, transverse modes to propagate, a situation
  that, for fermions, would lead to a conductance of only a few $h^-1$. By contrast,
  in our bosonic system, we observe conductances of thousands of $h^-1$, showing the
  definitive role played by particle statistics.'
