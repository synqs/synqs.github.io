abstract: We demonstrate experimentally an alternative method for the dynamic
  generation of atomic spin squeezing, building on the interplay between linear
  coupling and nonlinear phase evolution. Since the resulting quantum dynamics
  can be seen as rotation and shear on the generalized Bloch sphere, we call
  this scheme twist-and-turn. This is closely connected to an underlying
  instability in the classical limit of this system. The short-time evolution of
  the quantum state is governed by a fast initial spreading of the quantum
  uncertainty in one direction, accompanied by squeezing in the orthogonal axis.
  We find an optimal value of ξ2S=−7.1(3) dB in a single Bose-Einstein
  condensate and scalability of the squeezing to more than 104 particles with
  ξ2S=−2.8(4) dB.
