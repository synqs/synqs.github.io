abstract: Atomtronics is an emerging interdisciplinary field that seeks to develop
  new functional methods by creating devices and circuits where ultracold atoms, often
  superfluids, have a role analogous to that of electrons in electronics. Hysteresis
  is widely used in electronic circuits-it is routinely observed in superconducting
  circuits and is essential in radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference
  devices. Furthermore, it is as fundamental to superfluidity (and superconductivity)
  as quantized persistent currents, critical velocity and Josephson effects. Nevertheless,
  despite multiple theoretical predictions, hysteresis has not been previously observed
  in any superfluid, atomic-gas Bose-Einstein condensate. Here we directly detect
  hysteresis between quantized circulation states in an atomtronic circuit formed
  from a ring of superfluid Bose-Einstein condensate obstructed by a rotating weak
  link (a region of low atomic density). This contrasts with previous experiments
  on superfluid liquid helium where hysteresis was observed directly in systems in
  which the quantization of flow could not be observed, and indirectly in systems
  that showed quantized flow. Our techniques allow us to tune the size of the hysteresis
  loop and to consider the fundamental excitations that accompany hysteresis. The
  results suggest that the relevant excitations involved in hysteresis are vortices,
  and indicate that dissipation has an important role in the dynamics. Controlled
  hysteresis in atomtronic circuits may prove to be a crucial feature for the development
  of practical devices, just as it has in electronic circuits such as memories, digital
  noise filters (for example Schmitt triggers) and magnetometers (for example superconducting
  quantum interference devices).
