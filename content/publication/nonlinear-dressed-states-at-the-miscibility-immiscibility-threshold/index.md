abstract: The dynamical evolution of spatial patterns in a complex system can
  reveal the underlying structure and stability of stationary states. As a model
  system we employ a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate at the transition
  from miscible to immiscible with the additional control of linear
  interconversion. Excellent agreement is found between the detailed
  experimental time evolution and the corresponding numerical mean-field
  computations. Analyzing the dynamics of the system, we find clear indications
  of stationary states that we term nonlinear dressed states. A steady-state
  bifurcation analysis reveals a smooth connection of these states with
  dark-bright soliton solutions of the integrable two-component Manakov model.
