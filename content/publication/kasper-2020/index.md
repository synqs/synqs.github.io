abstract: Quantum information platforms made great progress in the control of many-body
  entanglement and the implementation of quantum error correction, but it remains
  a challenge to realize both in the same setup. Here, we propose a mixture of two
  ultracold atomic species as a platform for universal quantum computation with long-range
  entangling gates, while providing a natural candidate for quantum error-correction.
  In this proposed setup, one atomic species realizes localized collective spins of
  tunable length, which form the fundamental unit of information. The second atomic
  species yields phononic excitations, which are used to entangle collective spins.
  Finally, we discuss a finite-dimensional version of the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
  code to protect quantum information encoded in the collective spins, opening up
  the possibility to universal fault-tolerant quantum computation in ultracold atom
  systems.
