abstract: 'The Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) apparatus in Heidelberg offers the unique
ability to count the rare argon isotope 39Ar by addressing optical transitions in
the atom by laser light of narrow line width. The counting method utilizes the
high amount of scattering processes in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) for a distinct
capture of the desired isotope alone. In the course of this thesis, the design
and realization of a new laser system for ATTA will be presented. Measurements
conducted with small sample sizes demonstrated the stability and overall performance
of the renewed ATTA apparatus. For the second part of this thesis, the
MOT was examined under observation of the more abundant isotope 38Ar. In
order to maximize the fluorescence signal, the MOT trapping beams need to be
near-resonant to the atomic transition which unfortunately results in a disadvantageous
capture efficiency. The introduction of a second trapping laser with a
stronger red-detuning, overlying the original MOT beams, improves the loading
rate of the trap while maintaining a high scattering rate for detection.'
