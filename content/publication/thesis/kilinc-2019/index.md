abstract: 'This thesis describes the construction of a new apparatus to study
quantum gas mixtures of sodium and potassium. Our experimental
approach entails, using two independent two-dimensional magnetooptical
traps (2D MOTs) as sources of cold atoms for a dual-species
magneto optical trap (3D MOT).
Therefore, we have implemented a versatile laser system, with which
we are able to cool 39K, 40K and 23Na. The laser light, which is stabilized
to a spectroscopy line, is amplified with a home-built tapered
amplifier, split and finally frequency-shifted to generate the cooler,
repumper, Zeeman slower and push beam. We are able to switch between
the two potassium isotopes using a beat lock system. To trap the
atoms, we create magnetic quadrupole fields, employing permanent
magnets in the 2D MOTs and magnetic field coils in the 3D MOT.
Finally, I report on the implementation of a computer-based control
system, which automatizes experimental sequences and simplifies
parameter optimization processes.
Due to its tunability and flexibility, the new Na-K experiment will
serve as a platform to study quantum many-body physics ranging
from quantum thermodynamics to the investigation of lattice gauge
theories.'
