abstract: 'Universal dynamics of a dilute Bose gas is studied within the kinetic regime where
the time evolution of the mode occupation number is governed by a wave-Boltzmann
equation. The universality manifests itself in the form of the dynamical evolution
which can be a cascade in the context of Kolmogorov-Zakharov wave turbulence
or a self-similar shift in time and space. Which is the case depends on the relevant
global conservation laws and on the particular range of scales in which the
respective dynamics takes place. A nonperturbative kinetic equation is derived by
applying the Schwinger-Keldysh closed-time functional integral and the 2-particleirreducible
formalism to an action of complex scalar Bose fields with quartic interaction.
The resulting dynamic equation for two-point correlations are reduced to a
wave-Boltzmann-type kinetic equation with an effective T-matrix which depends explicitly
on the mode occupation numbers. This nonperturbative dependence on the
solution occurs in the infrared regime where wave numbers are large and collective
scattering of many particles prevails. Thus, the scaling analysis of wave turbulence
theory can be applied. We explicitly calculate the effective T-matrix analytically
taking into account an infrared cutoff for dealing with the infrared divergences. Our
results show that the scaling behaviour of the T-matrix departs from the one predicted
by naive dimensional counting due to the presence of the infrared cutoff. The
Kolmogorov-Zakharov and the self-similar exponents are evaluated by power counting
using our T-matrix and the results are confirmed by numerical integration of
the wave-Boltzmann scattering integral. The scaling exponents governing the time
evolution are determined by means of the global conservation laws and the kinetic
equation. Depending on the scaling properties of the quasiparticle spectrum, the
momentum cutoff scale in the infrared evolves critically slowed in time. The respective
scaling exponent is universal in the nonperturbative regime regardless of whether
the process is an inverse cascade or a self-similar shift towards the infrared. Thus,
our results provide a general framework for classifying nonthermal fixed points in
dilute ultracold Bose gases. They pave the way to a straightforward generalisation
and application to trapped systems in different dimensionalities and to systems with
more than one internal degree of freedom. Our results furthermore provide a possible
interpretation of recent experimental results on wave turbulence in an ultracold Bose
gas.'
