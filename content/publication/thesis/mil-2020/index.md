abstract: 'This thesis reports on the experimental realization of an elementary building
block for analog quantum simulation of a U(1) lattice gauge theory in a mixture
of two bosonic quantum gases. Experimentally, the building block is realized
by Bose-Einstein condensates of lithium and sodium condense d in a
single optical dipole trap. Gauge and matter degrees of freedom are mapped in
this system onto the internal states of the atomic species. The necessary U(1)
gauge invariance is realized via heteronuclear spin changing collisions (SCC)
between both species.

The building block represents an important stepstone towards quantum simulation
of extended lattice gauge theories as, within the same setting, it features
systematic protection of gauge invariance, a realistic approach of the continuum
limit for gauge fields and the potential for scalability.

Using SCC, systematic protection of gauge invariance in the system is achieved
by exploiting the inherent angular momentum conservation in the atomic mixture.
The continuum limit of gauge fields is recovered in the framework of quantum
link models by working with Bose-Einstein condensates with high atom numbers
in the order of $10^5$. The building block can be scaled up to an extended U(1) lattice
gauge theory by arranging individual building blocks on the sites of an optical
lattice and connecting them via Raman-assisted tunneling.

Great tunability of our experimental building block is demonstrated by studying
SCC dynamics as a function of various experimental parameters. We observe
coherent SCC interactions between both species after an initialization quench.
Furthermore, we recorded the SCC resonance as a function of this initialization
quench and the offset magnetic field. We present a theoretical framework for the
building block model based on a mean field theory with a phenomenological
decoherence term. Within this framework the experimental SCC measurements
are excellently described, identifying our experimental system as a faithful representation
of the building block.

Our results open up the possibility for extended lattice gauge theories based
on multiple building blocks. These systems will allow for quantum simulation
of gauge theories with the potential to address important questions in modern
physics that can currently not be simulated by classical computational techniques.'
