abstract: 'This thesis describes the construction of a second generation, ultracold
atomic mixture experiment, aiming for modularity, robustness and compactness.
The setup is designed to work with Bose-Fermi (23Na, 40K)
and Bose-Bose (23Na, 39K) mixtures. The experimental setup consists of
two separate two-dimensional magneto-optical traps (2D-MOTs) which
pre-cool the atoms to efficiently load them into the dual-species three dimensional
magneto-optical trap (3D-MOT). This serves as a source of cold atoms for further steps of the experiment. During the course of
this thesis, the mobile vacuum system as well as the laser system was
built up for both species, culminating in the recent observation of a
sodium 3D-MOT.'
