abstract: 'In this thesis, we study the structure formation following a quench of the detuning
of spin exchange. For this, we employ an effective spin-1 87Rb Bose-Einstein condensate
in a one-dimensional situation. Bogoliubov theory predicts unstable momentum modes for
specific regimes of the detuning. These are populated by spin-changing collisions and the
emerging structure can be observed in the transversal spin directions.
We present our experimental system and discuss the relevant parameters. After introducing
two analysis methods, the spin Fourier spectrum and the spatial correlation function,
we compare the homogeneous Bogoliubov theory to the experimentally obtained results for
short evolution times. The characteristic structure size follows the theoretical predictions.
Further, we discuss longer evolution times where the Bogoliubov approximation becomes
invalid. The observed behaviour can be partially understood by an altered interaction
strength due to the depletion of the condensed mode. We see first indications for emerging
structures that cannot be explained by Bogoliubov theory.'
