abstract: 'This thesis presents the design and implementation of a high resolution objective
lens for imaging ultracold atomic clouds of sodium and lithium in the NaLi
experiment. The lens has been developed using the ray tracing software OSLO. The
design process aimed for an objective lens that performs diffraction limited at a
high numerical aperture of 0.41 for both imaging wavelengths of sodium (589nm)
and lithium (671nm). Additionally, the lens design accounts for the requirements
regarding the installation into the existing experiment, determining the diameter
and working distance of the imaging objective.'
