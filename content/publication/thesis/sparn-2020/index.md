abstract: 'This thesis presents a setup capable of creating arbitrary potentials for a two-dimensional
Bose-Einstein condensate. A Digital Micromirror Device is used to spatially modulate and
thus shape a laser beam. Reimaged to the position of the atomic cloud, this laser beam can
create spatially configurable potentials. Numerical calculations of the resulting potentials and
light intensities in the trapping region are carried out for 39K and a laser with a wavelength of
532nm. Special emphasis is given to the implementation of variable intensities (grayscales)
via spatial averaging and mitigation of diffraction effects. It is shown that a high resolution of
the DMD is crucial for maximum grayscales and mitigation of distortions. Results from a
test setup are presented along with two algorithms aiming at the minimization of distortions
and diffraction effects. This setup can be transferred to the main experiment with only small
modifications.'
