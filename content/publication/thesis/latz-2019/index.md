abstract: 'Studying the entanglement among many particles is a central topic of current research in quantum
many-body systems and has great importance to the field of quantum metrology. In this context,
the quantum Fisher information (QFI) provides a powerful framework for assessing, classifying
and understanding the multipartite entanglement, and its metrological applications. Spinor
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) constitute a particularly versatile platform for experimental
investigations in this matter, however, a general and efficient experimental scheme for measuring
the QFI in spinor BECs is still missing. The aim of this Masterâ€™s thesis is therefore to bring
these two important concepts together by developing a protocol for the extraction of multipartite
entanglement in spin-1 BECs. To this end, we derive an overarching framework relying on
the computation of the QFI from quench dynamics and mean-field Bogoliubov theory. In a first
study, we examine the strong influence of spontaneous symmetry breaking on the many-particle
entanglement in single-mode BECs and compare our analysis to exact numerical calculations.
We expand this study to an one-dimensional system by extending the Bogoliubov formalism to
spin-1 quasi-condensates and deriving bounds for the entanglement of generic many-spin states.
In this way, we compute the finite temperature amount of entanglement in a spin-1 BEC from
dynamic susceptibilities after a weak quench. Our studies reveal the presence of multipartite
entanglement in spin-1 BECs and the growth of correlations in regions close to quantum phase
transitions. This work therefore paths the way towards the detection of multipartite entanglement
in spinor BECs.'
