abstract: 'We experimentally study a nonlinear detection scheme in which entangling interactions are time
reversed. In this way, nonclassical many-particle states are disentangled in order to enable their
feasible readout. In the context of quantum-enhanced sensing, such nonlinear readout techniques
extend the class of entangled probe states that can be leveraged for interrogation without being
limited by finite detector resolution.
As the underlying nonlinear mechanism, we employ spin exchange in a Bose-Einstein condensate.
The scattering process among spins can be controlled experimentally to not only generate
an entangled state but also the corresponding time reversed dynamics.
We explicitly demonstrate a quantum-enhanced measurement by constructing an atomic
SU(1,1) interferometer. Herein, spin exchange acts as an amplifier which spontaneously populates
initially empty spin states. The nascent entangled two-mode squeezed vacuum state enables
sensitive phase measurements. Checking whether or not the initial state is recovered after time
reversal reveals phase imprints. This scheme is capable of exhausting the quantum resource by
detecting solely average atom numbers, in principle, up to the fundamental Heisenberg limit of
phase estimation.
The intrinsic amplification of this interferometry scheme provides benefits for weak signals.
We experimentally explore the regime of an extended nonlinear readout in which noiseless amplification
permits to maintain quantum-enhanced phase sensitivity even for large magnifications.
Integrating nonlinear dynamics into the detection strategy is widely applicable. We provide
additional examples by using it as an autonomous building block which maps subtle quantum
correlations onto readily detectable quantities.'
