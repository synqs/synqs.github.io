abstract: In this thesis we study the quantum transport of matter waves with ultracold
  atoms. Such ultracold atom systems provide a very good control and a high flexibility
  of the parameters of the systems like the interactions, its dimensionality and the
  external potentials. This makes them a great tool for the investigation of several
  fundamental concepts of condensed matter physics. We focus on the quantumtransport
  in disordered media. It differs to classical transport by the fundamental role played
  by inference phenomena, which can eventually lead to the suppression of transport;
  known as Anderson Localization. Observing the expansion of a Bose-Einstein condensate
  in a strong light disorder, we show evidence for Localization of ultracold atoms
  in three dimensions. In the last part of this manuscript we discuss the observation
  of Coherent Backscat- tering of ultracold atoms, which is a direct signal of the
  role of quantum coherence in quantum transport in disordered media. We observe the
  time evolution of the momentum distribution of a cloud of ultra-cold atoms, launched
  with a narrow velocity distribution in a disordered potential. A peak emerges in
  in the backwards direction, corresponding to the CBS signal.
