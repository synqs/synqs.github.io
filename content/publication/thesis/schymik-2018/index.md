abstract: 'This thesis presents design and characterization of a versatile optical standingwave
trap for lithium atoms. Using this trap, an implementation of a quantized
Otto cycle with the sodium-lithium mixture experiment that cools down a cloud of
sodium atoms to quantum degeneracy while conserving the number of atoms may
be possible.
Three key characteristics which are crucial to the quantum Otto cycle are described:
First, spatial movement of the lithium cloud is implemented by adjusting
the relative phase of the two interfering beams up to $\Delta \theta = 3\pi$. Second, the energy
level spacing in the trap are adjustable by controlling the laser intensity. Third, the
spatial overlap between clouds of sodium and lithium atoms can be optimized by
an accordion setup with two electric tunable lenses which allows to change the
periodicity of the standing-wave dynamically by a factor of two.
Furthermore, the stability of the setup is characterized. An estimate on the trap
storage time based on heating rates by spontaneous emission, intensity and trap
center fluctuations is given. In the current setup, the storage time is limited by
detuning and power of the laser. With a 5nm blue-detuned setup the estimated
storage time is up to 4s, whereas intensity and trap center fluctuations would
allow for a estimated lifetime of bigger than 80s. The longterm trap center stability
was characterized and substantially improved by temperature stabilization of the electro-optical modulator crystal to approximately $0.3/\pi = 12 h$.
In the near future, this setup will be installed on the main experiment, allowing
the sodium-lithium experiment to become a test-bed for quantum thermodynamics.'
