abstract: 'The observation of many quantum effects in a spinor Bose gas rely on the possibility
for detection at the single-atom level. In a dedicated setup in our group
it has been shown that fluorescence imaging is capable of achieving single-atom
resolution even for mesoscopic atom numbers of up to 1200 atoms [1]. For that the
atoms are trapped in a magneto-optical trap (MOT) and the fluorescence signal
is recorded. By reducing mainly the background and fluorescence noise the signal
can be resolved at the single-atom level. We realised this in the BEC-experiment
by using four small fibre-coupled laser beams together with two bigger ones from
the usual experimental setup to produce a MOT. Additionally, we built an intensity
stabilisation system with LCD-shutter glasses for the fibre-coupled beams.
We observed the fluorescence signal with single-atom resolution for more than
twenty atoms in the sample and analysed the signal with respect to the different
noise contributions. With these values we can calculate the fidelity of this detector,
i.e. the probability to have detected the right atom number. In the end, ways
to improve the detection system are proposed and the possibility to already use
this system to measure the atomic Hong-Ou-Mandel effect is discussed.'
