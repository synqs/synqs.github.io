abstract: 'Approximate simulation methods of quantum many-body systems play an important role
for better understanding quantum mechanical phenomena, since due to the exponentially
scaling Hilbert space dimension these systems cannot be treated exactly. However, a
general simulation approach is still an outstanding problem, as all efficient approximation
schemes turn out to struggle in different regimes. Hence, a detailed knowledge about the
limitations is an important ingredient to approximation methods and requires further
studies. In this thesis we consider two simulation approaches, namely the discrete
truncated Wigner approximation as a semi-classical phase-space method, and a quantum
Monte Carlo method based on a quantum state parametrization via generative artificial
neural networks. We benchmark both schemes on sudden quenches in the transverse-field
Ising model and point out their limitations in the quantum critical regime, where strong
long-range interactions appear. Furthermore, we study the combination of the quantum
state representation in terms of artificial neural networks with the neuromorphic chips
present in the BrainScaleS group at Heidelberg University. The goal of this combination
is to simulate entangled quantum states on a classical analog hardware. We then
expect a more efficient way to approximately simulate quantum many-body systems by
overcoming the limitations of conventional computation architectures, as well as further
insights into quantum phenomena.'
