abstract: Aiming at a better understanding of anomalous and topological effects in
  gauge theories out-of-equilibrium, we study the real-time dynamics of a prototype
  model for CP-violation, the massive Schwinger model with a $\theta$-term.
  We identify dynamical quantum phase transitions between different topological sectors
  that appear after sufficiently strong quenches of the $\theta$-parameter.
  Moreover, we establish a general dynamical topological order parameter, which can
  be accessed through fermion two-point correlators and, importantly, which can be
  applied for interacting theories. Enabled by this result, we show that the topological
  transitions persist beyond the weak-coupling regime. Finally, these effects can
  be observed with table-top experiments based on existing cold-atom, superconducting-qubit,
  and trapped-ion technology. Our work, thus, presents a significant step towards
  quantum simulating topological and anomalous real-time phenomena relevant to nuclear
  and high-energy physics.
