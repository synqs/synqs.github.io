abstract: We study the elastic scattering time $\tau_S$ of ultracold atoms propagating
  in optical disordered potentials in the strong scattering regime, going beyond the
  recent work of J. Richard et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 122 100403 (2019). There, we
  identified the crossover between the weak and the strong scattering regimes by comparing
  direct measurements and numerical simulations to the first order Born approximation.
  Here we focus specifically on the strong scattering regime, where first order Born
  approximation is not valid anymore and the scattering time is strongly influenced
  by the nature of the disorder. To interpret our observations, we connect the scattering
  time $τ_S$ to the profiles of the spectral functions that we estimate using higher
  order Born perturbation theory or self-consistent Born approximation. The comparison
  reveals that self-consistent methods are well suited to describe $τ_S$ for Gaussian-distributed
  disorder, but fails for laser speckle disorder. For the latter, we show that the
  peculiar profiles of the spectral functions, as measured independently in V. Volchkov
  et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 060404 (2018), must be taken into account. Altogether
  our study characterizes the validity range of usual theoretical methods to predict
  the elastic scattering time of matter waves, which is essential for future close
  comparison between theory and experiments, for instance regarding the ongoing studies
  on Anderson localization
