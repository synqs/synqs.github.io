abstract: Radiometric dating with 39Ar covers a unique time span and offers key
  advances in interpreting environmental archives of the last millennium.
  Although this tracer has been acknowledged for decades, studies so far have
  been limited by the low abundance and radioactivity, thus requiring huge
  sample sizes. Atom trap trace analysis, an application of techniques from
  quantum physics such as laser cooling and trapping, allows us to reduce the
  sample volume by several orders of magnitude compared with conventional
  techniques. Here we show that the adaptation of this method to 39Ar is now
  available for glaciological applications, by demonstrating the entire process
  chain for dating of alpine glacier ice by argon trap trace analysis (ArTTA).
  Ice blocks as small as a few kilograms are sufficient and have been obtained
  at two artificial glacier caves. Importantly, both sites offer direct access
  to the stratigraphy at the glacier base and validation against existing age
  constraints. The ice blocks obtained at Chli Titlis glacier at 3,030 m asl
  (Swiss Alps) have been dated by state-of-the-art microradiocarbon analysis in
  a previous study. The unique finding of a bark fragment and a larch needle
  within the ice of Schaufelferner glacier at 2,870 m asl (Stubai Alps, Austria)
  allows for conventional radiocarbon dating. At both sites the existing age
  information based on radiocarbon dating and visual stratigraphy corroborates
  the 39Ar ages. With our results, we establish argon trap trace analysis as the
  key to decipher so far untapped glacier archives of the last millennium.
