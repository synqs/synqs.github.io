abstract: Ultracold gases provide an unprecedented level of control for the
  investigation of soliton dynamics and collisions. We present a scheme for
  deterministically preparing pairs of three-component solitons in a
  Bose-Einstein condensate. Our method is based on local spin rotations which
  simultaneously imprint suitable phase and density distributions. This enables
  us to observe striking collisional properties of the vector degree of freedom
  which naturally arises for the coherent nature of the emerging multicomponent
  solitons. We find that the solitonic properties in the quasi-one-dimensional
  system are quantitatively described by the integrable repulsive
  three-component Manakov model.
