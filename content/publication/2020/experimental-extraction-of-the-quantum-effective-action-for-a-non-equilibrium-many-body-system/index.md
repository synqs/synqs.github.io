abstract: On the fundamental level, quantum fluctuations or entanglement lead to
  complex dynamical behaviour in many-body systems for which a description as
  emergent phenomena can be found within the framework of quantum field theory.
  A central quantity in these efforts, containing all information about the
  measurable physical properties, is the quantum effective action. Though
  non-equilibrium quantum dynamics can be exactly formulated in terms of the
  quantum effective action, finding solutions is in general beyond the
  capabilities of classical computers. Here, we present a strategy to determine
  the non-equilibrium quantum effective action using analogue quantum
  simulators, and demonstrate our method experimentally with a
  quasi-one-dimensional spinor Bose gas out of equilibrium. Spatially resolved
  snapshots of the complex-valued transversal spin field allow us to infer the
  quantum effective action up to fourth order in an expansion in one-particle
  irreducible correlation functions at equal times. We uncover a strong
  suppression of the irreducible four vertex emerging at low momenta in the
  highly occupied regime far from equilibrium where perturbative descriptions
  fail. Our work constitutes a new realm of large-scale analogue quantum
  computing, where highly controlled synthetic quantum systems10 provide the
  means for solving theoretical problems in high-energy and condensed-matter
  physics with an experimental approach.
