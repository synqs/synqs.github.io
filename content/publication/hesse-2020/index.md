abstract: In atomic physics experiments, magnetic fields allow to control the interactions
  between atoms, eg. near Feshbach resonances, or by employing spin changing collisions.
  The magnetic field control is typically performed indirectly, by stabilizing the
  current of Helmholtz coils producing the large bias field. Here, we overcome the
  limitations of such an indirect control through a direct feedback scheme, which
  is based on nitrogen-vacancy centers acting as a sensor. This allows us to measure
  and stabilize magnetic fields of 46.6 G down to 1.2 mG RMS noise, with the potential
  of reaching much higher field strengths. Because the magnetic field is measured
  directly, we reach minimum shot-to-shot fluctuations of 0.32(4) ppm on a 22 minute
  time interval, ensuring high reproducibility of experiments. This approach extends
  the direct magnetic field control to high magnetic fields, which could enable new
  precise quantum simulations in this regime.
