abstract: For an efficient performance of atom-trap trace analysis, it is
  important to collimate the particles emitted from an effusive source. Their
  high velocity limits the interaction time with the cooling laser. Therefore,
  forces beyond the limits of the scattering force are desirable. The
  bichromatic force is a promising candidate for this purpose which is
  demonstrated here on metastable argon-40. The precollimated atoms are
  deflected in one dimension and the acquired Doppler shift is detected by
  absorption spectroscopy. With the experimentally accessible parameters, it was
  possible to measure a force three times stronger than the scattering force.
  Systematic studies on its dependence on Rabi frequency, phase difference, and
  detuning to atomic resonance are compared to the solution of the optical Bloch
  equations. We anticipate predictions for a possible application in atom-trap
  trace analysis of argon-39 and other noble gas experiments, where a high flux
  of metastable atoms is needed.
