abstract: We discuss the experimental engineering of model systems for the description
  of QED in one spatial dimension via a mixture of bosonic $^23$Na and fermionic $^6$Li
  atoms. The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical superlattice, using heteronuclear
  boson-fermion spin-changing interactions which preserve the total spin in every
  local collision. We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state
  of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such
  that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion
  about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon
  experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of
  bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the description
  of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking.
  This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic system and of QED itself
  using functional integral techniques. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics
  of one-dimensional QED may be realized with ultracold atoms using state-of-the-art
  experimental resources. The experimental setup proposed may provide a unique access
  to longstanding open questions for which classical computational methods are no
  longer applicable.
