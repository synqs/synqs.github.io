abstract: Accessing the connection between classical chaos and quantum many-body
  systems has been a long-standing experimental challenge. Here, we investigate
  the onset of chaos in periodically driven two-component Bose-Einstein
  condensates, whose small quantum uncertainties allow for exploring the phase
  space with high resolution. By analyzing the uncertainties of time-evolved
  many-body states, we find signatures of elliptic and hyperbolic periodic
  orbits generated according to the Poincaré-Birkhoff theorem, and the formation
  of a chaotic region at increasing driving strengths. The employed fluctuation
  analysis allows for probing the phase-space structure by use of only
  short-time quantum dynamics.
