abstract: The problem of understanding how a coherent, macroscopic Bose-Einstein
  condensate (BEC) emerges from the cooling of a thermal Bose gas has attracted
  significant theoretical and experimental interest over several decades. The
  pioneering achievement of BEC in weakly-interacting dilute atomic gases in
  1995 was followed by a number of experimental studies examining the growth of
  the BEC number, as well as the development of its coherence. More recently
  there has been interest in connecting such experiments to universal aspects of
  nonequilibrium phase transitions, in terms of both static and dynamical
  critical exponents. Here, the spontaneous formation of topological structures
  such as vortices and solitons in quenched cold-atom experiments has enabled
  the verification of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism predicting the density of
  topological defects in continuous phase transitions, first proposed in the
  context of the evolution of the early universe. This chapter reviews progress
  in the understanding of BEC formation, and discusses open questions and future
  research directions in the dynamics of phase transitions in quantum gases.
