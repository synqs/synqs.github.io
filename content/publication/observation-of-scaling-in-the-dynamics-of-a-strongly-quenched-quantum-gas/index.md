abstract: We report on the experimental observation of scaling in the time
  evolution following a sudden quench into the vicinity of a quantum critical
  point. The experimental system, a two-component Bose gas with coherent
  exchange between the constituents, allows for the necessary high level of
  control of parameters as well as the access to time-resolved spatial
  correlation functions. The theoretical analysis reveals that when quenching
  the system close to the critical point, the energy introduced by the quench
  leads to a short-time evolution exhibiting crossover reminiscent of the
  finite-temperature critical properties in the system’s universality class.
  Observing the time evolution after a quench represents a paradigm shift in
  accessing and probing experimentally universal properties close to a quantum
  critical point and allows in a new way benchmarking of quantum many-body
  theory with experiments.
