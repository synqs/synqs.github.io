abstract: We study howtemperature affects the lifetime of a quantized, persistent
  current state in a toroidal Bose-Einstein condensate. When the temperature is increased,
  we find a decrease in the persistent current lifetime. Comparing our measured decay
  rates to simple models of thermal activation and quantum tunneling,wedo not find
  agreement. We also measured the size of the hysteresis loops in our superfluid ring
  as a function of temperature, enabling us to extract the critical velocity. The
  measured critical velocity is found to depend strongly on temperature, approaching
  the zero-temperature mean-field solution as the temperature is decreased. This indicates
  that an appropriate definition of critical velocity must incorporate the role of
  thermalfluctuations, something not explicitly contained in traditional theories.
