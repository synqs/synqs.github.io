abstract: We experimentally demonstrate an atom number detector capable of
  simultaneous detection of two mesoscopic ensembles with single-atom
  resolution. Such a sensitivity is a prerequisite for quantum metrology at a
  precision approaching the Heisenberg limit. Our system is based on
  fluorescence detection of atoms in a hybrid trap in which a dipole barrier
  divides a magneto-optical trap into two separated wells. We introduce a noise
  model describing the various sources contributing to the measurement error and
  report a limit of up to 500 atoms for single-atom resolution in the atom
  number difference.
