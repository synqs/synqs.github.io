In this talk, I present our work on analog simulators of a U(1) gauge theory in one spatial dimension. To engineer the local gauge symmetry, we employ inter-species spin-changing collisions in an atomic mixture. We demonstrate the experimental realization of the elementary building block and discuss how it can be scaled to a U(1) gauge theory in one spatial dimension. Finally, I discuss our more recent studies on realizations in classical electric circuits.
