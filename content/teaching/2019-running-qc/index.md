In this lecture, we will explore the possibilities of first quantum computers like IBM-Q. We will discuss underlying concepts and different architectures. We will put special focus on a practical implementation of simple algorithms through the publicly available IBM-Q machine in the exercises. Please be aware that this is a completely new lecture as the field is rapidly evolving. So, expect some unexpected things. But the currently planned topics include:

- Quantum computing gates
- Algorithms like Shor or Grover
- Quantum simulation and annealing
- Entanglement
- Error correction and topological quantum computing

The discussed hardware architectures will (possibly) include:

- Ions
- Superconducting qubits
- Cold atoms
- Photons
- Majorana fermions
