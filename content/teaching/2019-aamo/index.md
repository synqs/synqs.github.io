This course will be your ideal preparation to enter the broad field of atomic, molecular and optical physics. It is advised to take this course before starting a master's thesis in one of the many research groups working on these topics in Heidelberg.

We will put a lot of emphasis on modern topics, such that at the end of the course you will be able to understand current research publications, and judge for yourself which topics you will find most exciting.
