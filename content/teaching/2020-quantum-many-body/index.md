The lecture course provides an introduction to field theoretic methods for systems with many degrees of freedom. A focus will be set on applications to ultracold, mostly bosonic, atomic gases, superfluids and superconductors as they are the subject of many fore-front present-day experiments. Methodologically, the lecture will introduce the basics of the operator as well as the path-integral approach to quantum field theory. In applying these techniques I will in particular concentrate on thermal and dynamical properties of the considered systems. Knowledge of the basics of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics is presumed while the course is designed to be self-contained on the quantum-field-theory side.
