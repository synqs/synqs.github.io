This lecture gives an introduction to topics related to quantum computing and quantum information theory. Video material will be complemented by homework exercises, including programming exercises, and tutorial sessions.

Topics include:
- Quantum circuit model: states, operations and measurements
- Quantum algorithms
- Quantum computational complexity classes
- Quantum channels, noise and decoherence
- Quantum error correction and fault tolerant quantum computing
- Quantum computing hardware overview
- Quantum information theory: basic concepts

Dates and time: Mondays 14:16-16:00h, online on zoom (link will be provided in the exercise group system), first session on 12.04.2021, Tutorials: Wednesday and Thursday 16:15-18:00h

If you want to participate in this lecture, please sign up for the <a href="https://uebungen.physik.uni-heidelberg.de/v/1328">tutorials</a>.

Course requirements: Basics knowledge of quantum mechanics (Theoretical Physics IV) and basic programming skills are required.

Mode of examination: The grade will be based on a written exam.
