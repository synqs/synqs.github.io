Nowadays, it has been possible to achieve control of quantum systems to an enormous degree on different hardware platforms. In this seminar we will discuss a variety of experiments based on assemblies of either photons, neutral atoms or ions, that highlight their capabilities to study quantum effects ranging from high precision measurements to complex many-body phenomena.
