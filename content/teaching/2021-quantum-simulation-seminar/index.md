Nowadays, it has been possible to achieve control of quantum systems to an enormous degree on different hardware platforms. In this seminar we will discuss a variety of experiments based on assemblies of either photons, neutral atoms or ions, that highlight their capabilities to study quantum effects ranging from high precision measurements to complex many-body phenomena.

_We schedule it currently as a weekly lecture. However, we would also be happy to set it up as a two or three day workshop in  September if student interest  is big enough. We will discuss this on the first lecture._ 

The proposed topics include


# Photons
- Bell inequalities
- Cloning
- EIT et light storage
- Super and subradiance
- Boson sampling

# Neutral atoms
- Tweezer and atom sorting
- Quantum gas microscopes
- Super solids
- Optical lattice clock

# Ions
- Cooling and clocks
- Schr√∂dinger cat
- Trotterization in ion chains
