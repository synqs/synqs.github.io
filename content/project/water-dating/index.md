The Heidelberg Argon Trap Trace Analysis (ArTTA) apparatus applies quantum optical methods to establish an ultra-sensitive detection method for the radioisotope 39Ar, which, with a half-life of 269 years, serves as a unique tracer for dating of environmental samples. The ratio of 39Ar to Ar in fresh air is 10−16. To distinguish the isotope of interest from the huge background of abundant isotopes the isotopic shift in optical resonance frequency is utilized. The high selectivity is achieved by a multitude of scattering processes, which are realized in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), where single atoms are captured and detected.
