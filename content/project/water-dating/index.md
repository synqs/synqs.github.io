The Heidelberg Argon Trap Trace Analysis (ArTTA) apparatus applies quantum optical methods to establish an ultra-sensitive detection method for the radioisotope $^{39}$Ar, which, with a half-life of 269 years, serves as a unique tracer for dating of environmental samples. The ratio of $^{39}$Ar to Ar in fresh air is 10$^{âˆ’15}$. To distinguish the isotope of interest from the huge background of abundant isotopes the isotopic shift in optical resonance frequency is utilized. The high selectivity is achieved by a multitude of scattering processes, which are realized in a magneto-optical trap (MOT), where single atoms are captured and detected.

**ATTA, ArTTA & KrypTTA** The difference between the three shortcuts is rather simple: **ATTA** is the general **A**tom **T**rap **T**race **A**nalysis technique, undependent of the isotope of interest. **ArTTA** and **KrypTTA** are used to specify the analysed isotope **Ar**gon ($^{39}$Ar), **Kryp**ton ($^{85}$Kr) respectively.
