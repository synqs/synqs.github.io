  title = {{PennyLane: Automatic differentiation of hybrid quantum-classical computations}},
  description = {PennyLane is a Python 3 software framework for optimization and machine learning of quantum and hybrid quantum-classical computations. The library provides a unified architecture for near-term quantum computing devices supporting both qubit and continuous-variable paradigms. PennyLane's core feature is the ability to compute gradients of variational quantum circuits in a way that is compatible with classical techniques such as backpropagation. PennyLane thus extends the automatic differentiation algorithms common in optimization and machine learning to include quantum and hybrid computations. A plugin system makes the framework compatible with any gate-based quantum simulator or hardware. We provide plugins for Strawberry Fields, Rigetti Forest, Qiskit, Cirq, and ProjectQ, allowing PennyLane optimizations to be run on publicly accessible quantum devices provided by Rigetti and IBM Q. On the classical front, PennyLane interfaces with accelerated machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and autograd. PennyLane can be used for the optimization of variational quantum eigensolvers, quantum approximate optimization, quantum machine learning models, and many other applications.},

  title = {{Toward scalable simulations of Lattice Gauge Theories on quantum computers}},
  description = {The simulation of real-time dynamics in lattice gauge theories is particularly hard for classical computing due to the exponential scaling of the required resources. On the other hand, quantum algorithms can potentially perform the same calculation with a polynomial dependence on the number of degrees of freedom. A precise estimation is however particularly challenging for the simulation of lattice gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions, where gauge fields are dynamical variables, in addition to the particle fields. Moreover, there exist several choices for discretizing particles and gauge fields on a lattice, each of them coming at different prices in terms of qubit register size and circuit depth. Here we provide a resource counting for real-time evolution of $U(1)$ gauge theories, such as Quantum Electrodynamics on arbitrary dimension using the Wilson fermion representation for the particles, and the Quantum Link Model approach for the gauge fields. We study the phenomena of flux-string breaking up to a genuine bi-dimensional model using classical simulations of the quantum circuits, and discuss the advantages of our discretization choice in simulation of more challenging $SU(N)$ gauge theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics.},
