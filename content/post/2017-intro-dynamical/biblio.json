		"abstract": "Hybrid classical–quantum algorithms aim to variationally solve optimization problems using a feedback loop between a classical computer and a quantum co-processor, while benefiting from quantum resources. Here we present experiments that demonstrate self-verifying, hybrid, variational quantum simulation of lattice models in condensed matter and high-energy physics. In contrast to analogue quantum simulation, this approach forgoes the requirement of realizing the targeted Hamiltonian directly in the laboratory, thus enabling the study of a wide variety of previously intractable target models. We focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a gauge theory of one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Our quantum co-processor is a programmable, trapped-ion analogue quantum simulator with up to 20 qubits, capable of generating families of entangled trial states respecting the symmetries of the target Hamiltonian. We determine ground states, energy gaps and additionally, by measuring variances of the Schwinger Hamiltonian, we provide algorithmic errors for the energies, thus taking a step towards verifying quantum simulation.",

An example is the quantum theory of electrons interacting with the electromagnetic field, based on U(1) gauge symmetry. Solving such gauge theories is in general a hard problem for classical computational techniques. Although quantum computers suggest a way forward, large-scale digital quantum devices for complex simulations are difficult to build. We propose a scalable analog quantum simulator of a U(1) gauge theory in one spatial dimension. Using interspecies spin-changing collisions in an atomic mixture, we achieve gauge-invariant interactions between matter and gauge fields with spin- and species-independent trapping potentials.

		"abstract": "The modern description of elementary particles, as formulated in the standard model of particle physics, is built on gauge theories1. Gauge theories implement fundamental laws of physics by local symmetry constraints. For example, in quantum electrodynamics Gauss’s law introduces an intrinsic local relation between charged matter and electromagnetic fields, which protects many salient physical properties, including massless photons and a long-ranged Coulomb law. Solving gauge theories using classical computers is an extremely arduous task2, which has stimulated an effort to simulate gauge-theory dynamics in microscopically engineered quantum devices3–6. Previous achievements implemented density-dependent Peierls phases without defining a local symmetry7,8, realized mappings onto effective models to integrate out either matter or electric fields9–12, or were limited to very small systems13–16. However, the essential gauge symmetry has not been observed experimentally. Here we report the quantum simulation of an extended U(1) lattice gauge theory, and experimentally quantify the gauge invariance in a many-body system comprising matter and gauge fields. These fields are realized in defect-free arrays of bosonic atoms in an optical superlattice of 71 sites. We demonstrate full tunability of the model parameters and benchmark the matter–gauge interactions by sweeping across a quantum phase transition. Using high-fidelity manipulation techniques, we measure the degree to which Gauss’s law is violated by extracting probabilities of locally gauge-invariant states from correlated atom occupations. Our work provides a way to explore gauge symmetry in the interplay of fundamental particles using controllable large-scale quantum simulators.",

    "abstract": "We construct lattice gauge theories in which the elements of the link matrices are represented by non-commuting operators acting in a Hilbert space. These quantum link models are related to ordinary lattice gauge theories in the same way as quantum spin models are related to ordinary classical spin systems. Here U(1) and SU(2) quantum link models are constructed explicitly. As Hamiltonian theories quantum link models are nonrelativistic gauge theories with potential applications in condensed matter physics. When formulated with a fifth Euclidean dimension, universality arguments suggest that dimensional reduction to four dimensions occurs. Hence, quantum link models are also reformulations of ordinary quantum field theories and are applicable to particle physics, for example to QCD. The configuration space of quantum link models is discrete and hence their numerical treatment should be simpler than that of ordinary lattice gauge theories with a continuous configuration space.",

For a setup in one spatial dimension, we investigate the nonequilibrium phenomenon of pair production including the backreaction leading to plasma oscillations. Unlike previous investigations on quantum link models, we focus on the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of QED and show that it may be well approximated by experiments employing Bose???Einstein condensates interacting with fermionic atoms. Numerical calculations based on functional integral techniques give a unique access to the physical parameters required to realize QED phenomena in a cold atom experiment. In particular, we use our approach to consider quantum link models in a yet unexplored parameter regime and give bounds for their ability to capture essential features of the physics.

    "abstract": "We discuss the experimental engineering of model systems for the description of QED in one spatial dimension via a mixture of bosonic \\$\\^{23}\\$Na and fermionic \\$\\^6\\$Li atoms. The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical superlattice, using heteronuclear boson-fermion spin-changing interactions which preserve the total spin in every local collision. We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system’s parameters required for the description of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking. This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic system and of QED itself using functional integral techniques. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of one-dimensional QED may be realized with ultracold atoms using state-of-the-art experimental resources. The experimental setup proposed may provide a unique access to longstanding open questions for which classical computational methods are no longer applicable.",
