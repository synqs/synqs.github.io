@article{Chandrasekharan1997,
  abstract = {We construct lattice gauge theories in which the elements of the link matrices are represented by non-commuting operators acting in a Hilbert space. These quantum link models are related to ordinary lattice gauge theories in the same way as quantum spin models are related to ordinary classical spin systems. Here U(1) and SU(2) quantum link models are constructed explicitly. As Hamiltonian theories quantum link models are nonrelativistic gauge theories with potential applications in condensed matter physics. When formulated with a fifth Euclidean dimension, universality arguments suggest that dimensional reduction to four dimensions occurs. Hence, quantum link models are also reformulations of ordinary quantum field theories and are applicable to particle physics, for example to QCD. The configuration space of quantum link models is discrete and hence their numerical treatment should be simpler than that of ordinary lattice gauge theories with a continuous configuration space.},

  abstract = {We construct a hamiltonian lattice gauge theory which possesses local SU (2) gauge invariance and yet is defined on a Hilbert space of 5-dimensional real vectors for every link. This construction does not allow for generalization to arbitrary SU(N), but a small variation of it can be generalized to an SU(N) ?? U(1) local gauge invariant model. The latter is solvable in simple gauge sectors leading to trivial spectra. We display these by studying a U(1) local gauge invariant model with similar characteristics. ?? 1981.},

  abstract = {We study lattice hamiltonians with continuous local SU(2) gauge invariance, for which the Hilbert space on each link is finite dimensional. As these are gauge-invariant generalizations of quantum magnets, we call them lattice gauge magnets. The generators of gauge transformations are built out of local spin operators. In the simplest version of such a theory, the gauge field components belong to a representation of the algebra SO(5). Long-wavelength excitations of this model are gapless and nonrelativistic at the tree level. In 2 + 1 dimensions, we study a parity violating model, which we argue is equivalent to the topologically massive Yang-Mills theory.},

@article{Kasper2016,
  abstract = {We consider a system of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice as a quantum simulator for electron???positron pair production in quantum electrodynamics (QED). For a setup in one spatial dimension, we investigate the nonequilibrium phenomenon of pair production including the backreaction leading to plasma oscillations. Unlike previous investigations on quantum link models, we focus on the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of QED and show that it may be well approximated by experiments employing Bose???Einstein condensates interacting with fermionic atoms. Numerical calculations based on functional integral techniques give a unique access to the physical parameters required to realize QED phenomena in a cold atom experiment. In particular, we use our approach to consider quantum link models in a yet unexplored parameter regime and give bounds for their ability to capture essential features of the physics. The results suggest a paradigmatic change towards realizations using coherent many-body states for quantum simulations of high-energy particle physics phenomena.},

@article{Kasper2017,
  abstract = {We discuss the experimental engineering of model systems for the description of QED in one spatial dimension via a mixture of bosonic {\$}{\^{}}{\{}23{\}}{\$}Na and fermionic {\$}{\^{}}6{\$}Li atoms. The local gauge symmetry is realized in an optical superlattice, using heteronuclear boson-fermion spin-changing interactions which preserve the total spin in every local collision. We consider a large number of bosons residing in the coherent state of a Bose-Einstein condensate on each link between the fermion lattice sites, such that the behavior of lattice QED in the continuum limit can be recovered. The discussion about the range of possible experimental parameters builds, in particular, upon experiences with related setups of fermions interacting with coherent samples of bosonic atoms. We determine the atomic system's parameters required for the description of fundamental QED processes, such as Schwinger pair production and string breaking. This is achieved by benchmark calculations of the atomic system and of QED itself using functional integral techniques. Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of one-dimensional QED may be realized with ultracold atoms using state-of-the-art experimental resources. The experimental setup proposed may provide a unique access to longstanding open questions for which classical computational methods are no longer applicable.},
